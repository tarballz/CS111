$FreeBSD: releng/10.3/tools/tools/nanobsd/dhcpd/README 274561 2014-11-16 01:29:18Z imp $

Example for creating many different builds (including different
arch) from a common set of files, as well as building natively
using qemu user space emulation.

This creates a simple appliance that uses dnsmasq to serve DNS
and DHCPd.

This is a work in progress. Generally, to build this you should
     cd tools/tools/nanobsd/dhcpd
     sudo sh ../nanobsd.sh -C os-base
but do be careful if things are interrupted. There may still be
bugs lurking that cause your entire FreeBSD tree to disappear.
