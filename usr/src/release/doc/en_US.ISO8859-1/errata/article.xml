	included in the release documentation.  This information
	includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the
	software or documentation that could affect its operation or
	usability.  An up-to-date version of this document should
	always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking
	news</quote> about &os; &release.prev; Before installing this
      version, it is important to consult this document to learn about
      any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have
      been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
	errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <link
	xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />, plus any
      sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

	<para>&os;/&arch.i386; &release.prev; running as a guest
	  operating system on <application>VirtualBox</application>
	  can have a problem with disk I/O access.  It depends on some
	  specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a
	  specific version of <application>VirtualBox</application> or
	  host operating system.</para>

	<para>It has been reported that instability may be present on
	  virtual machines running on other hypervisors, such as Xen
	  or KVM.</para>

	<para>It causes various errors and makes &os; quite unstable.
	  Although the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O
	  works as a workaround.  To disable it, choose
	  <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the boot menu
	  and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8; prompt,
	  after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<screen>set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
boot</screen>

	<para>Note that the following line has to be added to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> after a boot.  It
	  disables unmapped I/O at every boot:</para>

	<programlisting>vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0</programlisting>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>&os;/&arch.i386;&nbsp;&release.prev; installed on ZFS
	  may crash during boot when the ZFS pool mount is attempted
	  while booting an unmodified <literal>GENERIC</literal>
	  kernel.</para>

	<para>As described in <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>
	  entry <literal>20121223</literal>, rebuilding the kernel
	  with <literal>options KSTACK_PAGES=4</literal> has been
	  observed to resolve the boot-time crash.  This, however, is
	  not an ideal solution for inclusion in the
	  <literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel configuration, as
	  increasing <literal>KSTACK_PAGES</literal> implicitly
	  decreases available usermode threads in an environment that
	  is already resource-starved.</para>

	<para>Taking into account the heavy resource requirements of
	  ZFS, in addition to the &arch.i386;-specific tuning
	  requirements for general workloads, using ZFS with the
	  &os;/&arch.i386;&nbsp;<literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel
	  is strongly discouraged.</para>

	<para>If installing &os;/&arch.i386; on ZFS, it is possible to
	  configure the system after installation to increase the
	  <literal>KSTACK_PAGES</literal>.</para>

	<para>When prompted by &man.bsdinstall.8; to perform
	  additional post-installation configuration to the system,
	  select <guibutton>[&nbsp;YES&nbsp;]</guibutton>.</para>

	<para>This procedure requires the system sources available
	  locally.  If the <literal>System source code</literal>
	  distribution was not selected during installation, it can
	  be obtained using <application>svnlite</application>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; mkdir -p /usr/src
&prompt.root; svnlite co svn://svn.freebsd.org/base/releng/10.2 /usr/src</screen>

	<para>Build the <literal>kernel-toolchain</literal> required
	  to rebuild the kernel:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; make -C /usr/src kernel-toolchain</screen>

	<para>Next, create a kernel configuration file to increase the
	  <literal>KSTACK_PAGES</literal> option:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; printf "include GENERIC\noptions KSTACK_PAGES=4\n" &gt; <filename>/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/<replaceable>ZFS</replaceable></filename></screen>

	<para>Then build and install the
	  <replaceable>ZFS</replaceable> kernel:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; make -C /usr/src buildkernel KERNCONF=<replaceable>ZFS</replaceable>
&prompt.root; make -C /usr/src installkernel KERNCONF=<replaceable>ZFS</replaceable></screen>

	<warning>
	  <para>It is extremely important to take note that, by
	    default, &man.freebsd-update.8; will install the
	    <literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel configuration, and
	    as such, &man.freebsd-update.8; consumers are strongly
	    encouraged to avoid &os;-provided kernel binary upgrades
	    with such configurations.</para>
	</warning>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Due to an incompatibility between &man.bsdconfig.8;
	  and &man.pkg.8;, packages included on the &os;&nbsp;dvd
	  installer will not be recognized by
	  &man.bsdconfig.8;.</para>

	<para>To install packages from the <literal>dvd1.iso</literal>
	  installer, create the <filename
	    class="directory">/dist</filename> target directory, and
	  manually mount the <literal>dvd1.iso</literal>
	  <acronym>ISO</acronym>:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; mkdir -p /dist
&prompt.root; mount -t cd9660 /dev/<replaceable>cd0</replaceable> /dist</screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Be sure to use the correct <filename
	      class="directory">/dev</filename> device path for the
	    <literal>dvd1.iso</literal> <acronym>ISO</acronym>
	    installer.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Next, set <envar>REPOS_DIR</envar> to the path of the
	  <filename class="directory">repos/</filename> directory
	  within the installer so &man.pkg.8; will use the correct
	  repository metadata.</para>

	<para>If using &man.sh.1;:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; export REPOS_DIR=/dist/packages/repos</screen>

	<para>If using &man.csh.1;:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; setenv REPOS_DIR /dist/packages/repos</screen>

	<note>
	  <para>Keep in mind that <envar>REPOS_DIR</envar> will need
	    to be set again after the current shell session is
	    terminated, if continuing to use the packages provided on
	    the <literal>dvd1.iso</literal> installer.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Finally, bootstrap &man.pkg.8; from the
	  <acronym>ISO</acronym>, and install required
	  packages:</para>

	<screen>&prompt.root; pkg bootstrap
&prompt.root; pkg install <replaceable>xorg-server</replaceable> <replaceable>xorg</replaceable> <replaceable>gnome3</replaceable> [...]</screen>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>An issue was discovered where the &man.netstat.1;
	  <literal>-s</literal> option will cause a segmentation fault
	  on systems with <literal>IPSEC</literal> compiled into the
	  kernel.  The issue was resolved in the
	  <literal>stable/10</literal> branch, and an Errata Notice is
	  planned after &release.prev; is released.</para>

	<para>[2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:12.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>An issue was discovered that causes &man.make.1; to
	  generate noisy output when doing source-based upgrades from
	  &os; 9.3 and earlier.  The issue was reported in PR 202277,
	  and after investigation and determining the issue does not
	  cause source-based upgrades to fail, a post-release Errata
	  Notice is planned.</para>

	<para>[2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:11.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>An issue with &os; virtual machines with
	  <application>vagrant</application> was discovered that
	  affects the <application>VirtualBox</application> where the
	  virtual machine will not start on the initial boot invoked
	  with <literal>vagrant up</literal>.</para>

	<para>The issue is due to the virtual machine
	  <acronym>MAC</acronym> being unset, as &os; does not provide
	  a default <filename>Vagrantfile</filename>.</para>

	<para>It has been observed, however, that a subsequent
	  invocation of <literal>vagrant up</literal> will allow the
	  virtual machine to successfully boot, allowing access via
	  <literal>vagrant ssh</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2015-08-16] An error was discovered in the release
	  notes for &os; &release.prev; regarding the
	  <literal>drm</literal> device driver.  The entry for r282199
	  states the driver was updated to match the version &linux;
	  3.8.13 version, however the entry should have noted the
	  change affects device-independent code, and does not bring
	  the <literal>drm</literal> driver fully in line with the
	  stated &linux; version.</para>
